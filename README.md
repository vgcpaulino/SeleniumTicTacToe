# Playing Tic Tac Toe with Selenium

## Description:
This project it was created just for fun, after I saw some cool projects using Selenium to play the Chrome Dino game, or playing piano music.

The following link contains the game, all the elements in the game are common html elements. So it's pretty easy interact with them.
