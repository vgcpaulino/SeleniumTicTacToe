# Playing Tic Tac Toe with Selenium

## Description:
This project was created just for fun after I saw some cool projects using Selenium to play the Chrome Dino game, or playing piano music. 

The following link contains the game, all the elements in the game are common HTML elements. So it's pretty easy to interact with them.
